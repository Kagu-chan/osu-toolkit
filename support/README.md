osu!toolkit Support
===================

osu!toolkit allow direct support for projects using this library. This means advertising of this projects and code support if required.

A list of supported projects you can view [here](LIST).

How does it works?
------------------
It is the main goal to make developing tools for osu! easier and consistent. This means code and functionality. Not everyone have to code the same functions and not everyone does have time or ability to understand how osu! works exactly - or update all content is osu! changes something. Just refer this library, use it and keep it updated.

If you want to use this library, this would make me happy, and so I decided to support it additionally here with some help. To get your project supported, just follow the rules:

* Your project must be written in C# or .NET
* Your project must be hosted and up to date on github
* You have to use clean code

If this applies, I will provide my help:

* Listing (and advertising) your project
* Keep the main functionality updated
* If I change something of the API, I'll try to inform you to change your code OR change your code by myself and send a pull request
* Try to help finding bugs or weird code and help to fix them

If you want this help, 

* Host your project
* Create an issue ticket with project details
